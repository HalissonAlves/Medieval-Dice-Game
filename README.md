## Rules of the game
* Roll the dice to try to accumulate points.
* Be careful not to lose what you have already won.
* If you get 1 in one of the dice, your points of the round will be zeroed and the turn will be of the next player.
* If you get 6 on both dice simultaneously, you lose all points you have saved on match and the turn will be of the next player.
* The winner of the game will be the one who can accumulate the amount of points of the final score.

**Have Fun!**
